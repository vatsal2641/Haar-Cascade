# Haar-Cascade

Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based object detection algorithm used to identify objects or specific patterns within images or video frames. It was introduced by Viola and Jones in their seminal paper in 2001. Haar Cascade is particularly effective in detecting faces, but it can also be trained to detect other objects like eyes, noses, cars, or even custom objects.

## Haar Cascade Face Detection

The face detection in this project is accomplished using the Haar Cascade classifier. Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based object detection algorithm introduced by Viola and Jones in 2001. It is particularly effective for detecting faces in images and videos.

In the provided code, the Haar Cascade classifier is used to detect faces in both the training dataset and the group image for recognition. The pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier specifically designed for upper body detection is imported from the OpenCV library. This classifier is trained to identify patterns in images that resemble faces.

Once the faces are detected using Haar Cascade, further steps are performed for face recognition, including feature extraction and classification. These steps utilize the detected face regions to compute face descriptors and make predictions based on the trained classifier.

The Haar Cascade classifier plays a crucial role in identifying the faces in the images and serves as the initial step for face recognition in this project.
